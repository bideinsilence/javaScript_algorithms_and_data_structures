# freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures solutions
I'm working through these to regularly get more practice with JavaScript syntax,
algorithms, and data structures.
[freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org)

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** Just JavaScript so far.

## Optimizations
Since I use these for practice, I try and best understand the lesson attempting
to be taught and come to a solution accordingly. If a problem is fresh in my
mind, or if I come across a new way of doing things that triggers a memory of
one these, I intended to return and refactor my solution. And as I review these in
the future, I intend to refactor from advanced experience.

## Lessons Learned:
These are usually fun, and occasionally challenging, problems to try and
wrap my head around and get a little extra coding practice with.
